# How to claim land

![claim](/img/f3g.png)

Land is divided in to claims. One claim is exactly 16x16 blocks and perfectly lines up with Minecraft chunks. Press F3+G view chunk (claim) borders. 

Claiming a chunk costs 16 gold. To claim a chunk;

1. Deposit 16 or more gold to your town bank. All town expenses are paid through the town bank. `/t deposit 16`. 
2. Stand in a chunk you want to claim adjacent to a chunk the town already owns.
3. Run command `/t claim`.

You successfully claim the chunk!

Your town can at first only claim 8 chunks. You can increase this number by 8 for every resident who joins. Your maximum amount of chunks can also increase through a nation bonus, this is an amount of max claimable chunks added to every town in a nation. It ranges from 10 extra chunks all the way to 140 scaling based off of total residents in a nation. 10 chunks is from simply being in a nation, 140 is from having 50 residents in your whole nation.

:::caution

Claming in straight lines extending from a town (aka claim arm) is not allowed. These are protrusions which are often used to block the expansion of other towns or just artificially expand the area a town controls without the need to claim all of it. These will be removed without refund.
