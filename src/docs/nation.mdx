# Create a nation
Creating a new nation costs 1024 gold, deposit at least 1024 gold using `/t deposit 1024`. Only a mayor of a town can create a nation. The mayor's town will become the nation capital. Create the nation with `/n new`. After creation, the mayor will become king.

:::caution

Make sure your nation name complies with the nation naming rules. It has to have the same name as a real current or past nation. Read rules page for more information.

## Useful commands
As king of your nation you can add allies with `/n ally add` and invite towns to your nation with `/n add`. Towns added must be in a proximity of 3000 blocks from the capital's homeblock in order to be added. 

Give and remove ranks from citizens of your nation with `/n rank add username rank` or `/n rank remove username rank`. You can also kick towns from the nation with `/n kick`, delete the nation with `/n delete`, toggle public joining to your nation with `/n toggle open` and set the nationâ€™s spawn location anywhere within your capital with `/n set spawn`.

Due to nations starting with no allies you will likely want to get a lot as quickly as you can as you require them to travel anywhere with the `/n spawn` command. An efficient way to do so is by regularly checking `/res list`, and running the `/res` command on all nation kings as marked by a yellow name, then do `/t town_name` for the town listed in their `/res` and send an ally request to them.

As your nation gains more citizens your ranking on `/n list` will increase. Nations fight each other to be on the top of this list as it shows who has put the most time into recruiting towns and players which is a good indicator of activity. Nations also compete to have the most townblocks in their nation, this can be seen on `/n list by townblocks`.

## Nation ranks

**Chancellor** allows the player to do everything a king can do except delete the nation, set the capital and set the king. This is a dangerous rank to give as a player with it could remove every ally making it impossible for you to travel or kick every town from your nation.

**Colonist** allows the player to invite towns to the nation.

**Royal-treasurer** allows the player to deposit and withdraw gold to and from the nation bank.
