# Create a town

![town](/img/town.png)

Creating a town costs 64 gold.

Stand in the location where you want the town to be. Run command `/t new`. You now have a town with the size of a chunk.

You can spawn directly to your town with `/t spawn`.

Invite residents with `/t invite`.

Town gets deleted after 42 days if no single resident has joined the server in that period of time.

:::tip

Avoid giving your residents a pre-made house and too much free gear. Let your residents grow and develop with your town. This improves resident retention.
