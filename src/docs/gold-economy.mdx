# Gold economy
The currency on EarthMC is based on [gold ingots](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Ingot). 1 gold ingot is 1 unit of currency. The EarthMC economy is inflation resistant with efficient [gold sinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_sink). Gold is always in high demand which in turn creates a great gameplay experience and market environment. The large majority of items and services sold are provided by the players.

## How to get gold
* **Mining** - Mining is one of the best ways to get gold. Dig down, find gold ore, smelt it in a furnace. You already know how this works.
* **Raiding** - Find abandoned towns and loot the riches. Stealing is allowed on EarthMC.
* **Voting** - Run the command `/vote` and click the provided links. You will receive a gold crate with a random award up to 64 gold ingots after successfully voting for the server.
* **Shops** - Sell your items to other players with the advanced shop system. It's a great way to make gold while you're offline.

## Manage your gold
The safest place for gold is in an ender chest. Gold can also be deposited in to the virtual town/nation bank. This will allow residents with appropriate permissions to withdraw gold and use it for town/nation expenses such as claiming. To deposit, run `/t deposit` or `/n deposit`. With withdraw, run `/t withdraw` or `/n withdraw`.
